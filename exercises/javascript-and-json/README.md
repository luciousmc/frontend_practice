Converting data to and from strings.

### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (from `master`) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md). Then navigate to the `exercises/javascript-and-json` directory in your terminal.

### Exercise

1. Read about JSON in the MDN WebDocs - [No, really, what is JSON?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON#No_really_what_is_JSON).
1. Read about the purpose of serialization on Stack Overflow - [What is serialization?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/633402/what-is-serialization)
1. Create an `index.html` containing a basic skeleton and add a `script` tag with a `src` attribute of `"main.js"`.
1. Within `main.js`:
    - Create an `Array` of three `Object` literals representing books.
    - Give each book an `isbn`, a `title`, and an `author` (all `Strings`).
    - Use [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) to create a JSON `String` of your books `Array` and log the result and its type to the console (see [typeof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof)).
    - Create a `String` in JSON format holding data representing a student with a `Number id` and a `String name`.
    - Use [JSON.parse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) to create a JavaScript `Object` from your JSON `String` and log the result and its type to the console (see [typeof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof)).
