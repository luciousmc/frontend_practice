Communicating between clients and servers on the web.

### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (from `master`) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md). Then navigate to the `exercises/http-messages` directory in your terminal.

### Exercise

1. Read the introduction to the [Client-Server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model), [Client-server roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model#Client_and_server_role), and [Client-server communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model#Client_and_server_communication) on Wikipedia.
1. Read about [HTTP Message formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages) in the MDN Web Docs.
1. [Use HTTPie](https://httpie.org/doc#usage) in your terminal to send a `GET` request to `http://example.com` and compare the output to the **response** format that you've read about. **Note:** The `http` command should already be available in your development environment. If not, notify an instructor.
1. Send the same request again, but with the [`--verbose` output option](https://httpie.org/doc#output-options) to see the **request** you sent followed by the **response** you received.
1. Visit [`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) in your web browser and inspect the request in the **Network** tab of the developer tools.
1. Use the following HTTPie command to create a file named `users.json`. Then inspect the contents of the file.
    ```bash
    http --body GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users > users.json
    ```
1. Use the following HTTPie command to create a file named `example.html`. Then inspect the contents of the file.
    ```bash
    http --body GET https://example.com > index.html
    ```
